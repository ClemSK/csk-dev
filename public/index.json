A sentiment I\u0026rsquo;ve been resonating more with is that it\u0026rsquo;s good but only just so - the bigger issue is actually knowledge atrophy and the loss of the craft / imagination of people. if an image can be generated, why draw? If text can be written, why write? if code can be generated, why program? This is the problem. One argument is that things should be done for their own sake, but actually relinquishing full creative output to the Other will lead to a steady decline in faculties we once cherished. My biggest issue is that chatbots confidently give you crap and hallucinate, chasing wild geese. You might as well go for a walk and have a think. Sometimes you need a sparring partner, but more often than not, it\u0026rsquo;s just a question of time and a bit more thought. Chatbots are predictive machines; I\u0026rsquo;d argue the true genius is in human creation. There is more coming (rethinking of the transformer being the foundation for the next generation of AI, \u0026lsquo;World models\u0026rsquo;, etc.), but I think the current generation of models is plateauing. LLM creativity is bounded by small context and they are unable to solve moderately complex problems in a specific domain and do tasks that humans find easy still. They are marketed as a solution to drive automation and I agree to a point. However, they are not an endgame solution. Find creativity in the hard work, the struggle, the time it takes to make something great. Greatness and expertise cannot be generated, but it can be assisted. That\u0026rsquo;s where the balance lies: have tasks simplified and pushed along by the chatbots but the real work must come from you. What does changing the world mean? Another app? A faster phone / laptop? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure.. Philosophy and expression Thinking of some of the greatest minds in philosophy (List of your philosopher(s) of choice) - they helped us make leaps in how we think of ourselves and the choices we make. The major shifts came from deep thought. It took me some time I\u0026rsquo;m learning about ML and really enjoying it, thinking of some of the deeper issues made me think about what really matters to make big change happen - changes of behaviour in society Today computed thought is cheap (meaning of less value than human thought), and attention the currency - Tools should remain just that. Tools. What is the purpose of these tools? What is their value? Seems a shame to lose one of the essences of humanity: self-expression. If the chatbots homogenise our output, does culture get flattened? What is the role of art if it\u0026rsquo;s generated? The deeper problem is maybe the loss of free thinking? It\u0026rsquo;s not about faster horses (à la Ford), but where are we going with this? It seems that we\u0026rsquo;re living in an age of AI where if the words are said enough times, like an incantation, the miraculous future will come to be Seems like fanaticism I\u0026rsquo;m of the view the Kasparov expressed, it should be people + machines, not just machines. Not the last Transformer I listened to a podcast about the current architectures for transformer-based models, there is a possibility to move forward in that direction, but to get to the next generation of models a new architecture is needed. This means more investment, unfortunately, the industry has invested in the transformer architecture, and it will take an undeniably better solution to move to a new style of architecture. I believe that we are still in the first wave of the LLM-based AI change but that this is far from the end of the line.

Deep learning for coders: Wow! In 2025, with so many AI products coming out, it seems like a good idea to properly learn what it\u0026rsquo;s all about and how I can build my own models and integrate them into a project.\nIn my initial foray into learning ML, I found that the AI for Everyone course by Andrew NG was a good intro to the topic and ideas at a very high level. It\u0026rsquo;s a good basis for understanding the lay of the land and the different areas to dive into.\nHowever, my mind was blown when I started the Practical deep learning for coders by Jeremy Howard. In the first 2 lessons (around 2-3 hours of setup and then running through the lessons) I was able to:\nTrain an image classifier Learn how to host and deploy a model via API Given that I have no experience in ML, I was extremly impressed that I could see a clear path to implementing features that use Deep Learning in a very short space of time.\nIn my project, I want to generate reports based on London property data and combine it with a rating of room finishings. Manually this would be very slow and time consuming, but with ML it would put the product in a class of its own (if I manage to create an accurate model).\nIt also paves the way to implementing other types of ML features into my application using tabular and text data.\nTo use these models I\u0026rsquo;m going to add a Python server to my setup. There are several reasons for this:\nMy primary server is written in Go, which does not have a developed ML ecosystem I want to be able to call the models via API to either call them directly or from my Go server As I alluded to above, I might implement further ML features, so having a dedicated service to handle this makes sense rather than just calling python file here and there Go is fast and more than capable of serious data crunching, however, there might be cases where it makes sense to leverage libraries in the python ecosystem Python was my first programming language, with it I learnt to OOP, the main algorithms + data structures and did a few data/scraping projects with it so it\u0026rsquo;s nice to use it again!

If not, hopefully some of this translates or is food for thought.\nThis was honestly a pain in the arse, mostly because of the feedback loops for seeing if DNS has worked is measured in days and there are no good error messages other than \u0026rsquo;not working\u0026rsquo; in SendGrid. This leaves you guessing and trawling the internet for things to try to get it working.\nThe reasons for needing email in my app are the typical scenarios: 1) account creation 2) password resetting 3) communication (features / changes / news).\nThe added benefit is the ability to brand links so the emails will be sent from @london-property-pulse.com. This is small but one of my favourite things to feel real / professional.\nSet up 1. Create a non-Gmail account This is something that SendGrid requires you to do. I chose Outlook, use whatever you like. What this means is that a lot of spammers use throw-away Gmail accounts and cannot be trusted with an email blaster.\n2. Verify the email You know the drill, just follow the steps SendGrid tell you to follow.\n3. Adding the SendGrid DNS records to Cloudflare This is the fun bit where you add a bunch of CNAME and a couple of TXT records, effectively hooking up SendGrid to Cloudflare. Keep in mind, when you\u0026rsquo;re done it takes 1 - 2 days for changes to be registered by DNS servers. When setting these up, make sure to turn off the Cloudflare special-sauce DNS proxying (orange cloud thing). This was half the reason I wasn\u0026rsquo;t seeing the DNS resolve.\nWhy Turn off DNS proxying? There are a number of reasons for this but, in a nutshell, the proxying prevents SSL cert validation on the origin server and reduces email deliverability due to the disruption of DKIM authentication. The second part means that your emails will all end up in spam folders 💩\n4. Turning on email routing in Cloudflare This was a source of frustration and something I didn\u0026rsquo;t turn on until much later. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand why the DNS wasn\u0026rsquo;t propagating despite triple checking for typos and processes.\nAfter turning on this setting under the Email tab in the Cloudflare dashboard, you\u0026rsquo;re asked to add several email related MX type DNS records. This is the second part of the magic to get things working. Without it your DNS server won\u0026rsquo;t process email. You need to register an email for this, I used the same email as the one used to send and receive emails in SendGrid.\nTo call it out, the issue was not due to CNAME flattening. Apparently this is an issue for some people and a setting that is not available to modify (read turn-off) for top level domains (e.g. london-property-pulse.com). It also makes no difference if your DNS server can resolve it, which apparently Cloudflare does.\nAdditional context: when setting the CNAME values, SendGrid asks you to add a CNAME host like xxx.london-property-pulse.com, on save Cloudflare shortens it to just xxx in the console, also called CNAME flattening.\nMore on that here: CNAME flattening\n5. Checking DNS is working with email There are 2 ways of doing this: 1) using the SendGrid verify button where the DNS records to configure are listed 2) using a 3rd party tool like DNSChecker.org.\nI checked about once or twice a day to see if the DNS had resolved in SendGrid and DNSChecker, and then thinking of all the possible reasons why it hadn\u0026rsquo;t. Definitely land-of-confusion moments!\nThe old faithful here: DNSChecker.org\nNext steps and recommendations I\u0026rsquo;ve not tested the sending of emails, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad to be out of settings dashboards / click-ops and back into code to get the email sending working.\nI definitely recommend setting up the email DNS before you need it as it does take a while to get it working due to the slowness of propagation. It\u0026rsquo;s also something that you can do in the background while working on other things.\nThe good thing about DNS is that once it\u0026rsquo;s configured it\u0026rsquo;s set-and-forget!\n","permalink":"https://clem-sk.dev/posts/linking-sendgrid-and-cloudflare-dns/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor this to make sense, I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that you have accounts with both \u003ccode\u003eCloudflare\u003c/code\u003e as your DNS provider and \u003ccode\u003eSendGrid\u003c/code\u003e as your email provider.

Launching is a euphoric and satisfying moment where you feel \u0026lsquo;Hooray, I\u0026rsquo;m on the Internet 🎉\u0026rsquo;!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to launching early 🍻\nThe site is definitely far from ready, with bare-bone BE and FE but this way I can see how my changes affect the site\u0026rsquo;s performance and build in public. It also helps my motivation: now it\u0026rsquo;s real and in the world 🌍.\nLearnings Getting familiar with Linux I\u0026rsquo;m trying something new by hosting on a virtual private server (VPS) - aka Linux box in the cloud - and had a few things to learn along the way but got there in about a day. While I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with unix environments, working without the bells and whistles of my comfy and configured environment was a bit of a shock but relatively easy to work.\nExceeding low resources is way to easy I started using the most basic plan my VPS provider offered but quickly found that it was running out of memory as I was trying to build my docker images. In the end I bumped up the spec twice to get the performance necessary to run my setup. As I\u0026rsquo;m going to be using a lot data the additional disk space was welcome but I thought that might come later in the process than it did. It was an eye opener that my setup couldn\u0026rsquo;t run properly on 1GB of memory, however performant.\nResponsibility for being in control \u0026lsquo;Nice I control everything! ..oh, I have to manage what now?!\u0026rsquo;\nPart of launching this site was to learn how to manage the details of hosting a site, saving costs, getting in the weeds of devops and so far ✅. Though, I have had to configure ports, permissions, miscellaneous configurations and a firewall. I now understand that managed services charge more, but honestly for a little more hassle and significantly smaller bill it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. The flip side is that I now have more freedom about what happens on my server than the likes of Vercel, Railway and Netlify would expose to me.\nDNS This time around it was much easier to hook up my domain to my IP address and register it with the registrar. Last time I struggled with configuration of my domain with Netlify and Cloudflare name servers. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m getting better, or just following standard practice better 🤷‍♂️. The harder part of the launch of my site was getting my pipeline to work correctly.\nDocker and pipeline secrets + automating builds As good practice I have my pipeline build and push my code to my container registry and then use the new image to deploy to my VPS. However, I found working with GitHub and Docker a bit of a faff. I worked it out in the end but it took about a million runs of the pipeline and debugging the statements before getting a clean run and deploying to the VPS. Part of the issue was the lack of power of the VPS making it impossible to run the code. I had to restart the VPS several times when it would even refuse SSH connections.\nArchitecture I watched a great talk from Amazon on YT which outlines realistic architectures at different scales and studied the system design primer. They helped guide me to not over-engineer my current approach but also prepare for scale.\nThere are 4 parts to the setup: 1. Docker, 2. Caddy, 3. Go, 4. React, 5.Postgres\nContainerisation with Docker The main benefits of Docker are consistent environments and easy replication. Due to this, it means I can have secure builds that can be deployed and scaled to multiple instances as needed. It would also make it easy to move to anther cloud provider.\nCaddy web server Caddy acts as the front-door to the site and works in a monorepo or micro-services contexts. I set up the web server to act as a reverse proxy, file server and rate-limiter, with capabilities for load-balancing and Caddy made that a breeze.\nGo backend I chose Go mostly because I like it but it\u0026rsquo;s also performant, resource efficient, has great concurrency and can be deployed in Linux, Mac and Windows environments.\nReact frontend React was mostly a fallback and could have been another framework but is fast to get started and has a large ecosystem to leverage. I tried using Templ but found that it was too limiting and slowing me down for trivial things that would be easy to do in a React context. Ultimately, I used React because if Templ was challenging to use and there was very little code, what would it be like when there was complexity and a lot more code? Moreover, Templ\u0026rsquo;s state management story was not for me. In this situation I picked a larger bundle size, JS/TS, speed, and a broader ecosystem over server rendering interactions.\nPostgres database Choosing between Postgres and MongoDB as a starting option, my view is that Postgres is the sensible default. I like the structure of types and querying power of a relational DB. That being said, my application is going to be read heavy and I will be performing a number of queries on the data so a relational DB makes more sense at this point.\nNow the real work starts I felt a need to launch the site, now it is I can start on core feature work that will bring the site to life. 🚀\n","permalink":"https://clem-sk.dev/posts/launching-a-site/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYesterday \u003ca href=\"https://london-property-pulse.com\"\u003eLondon Property Pulse\u003c/a\u003e went live.

The virtuous cycle continues in this process, driven by my wandering curiosity.\nAbout me I\u0026rsquo;m Clem. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in different fields but my found that my \u0026lsquo;home\u0026rsquo; in programming.\nIn 2020, wanting automate tasks, I started to learn to code with Learn Python the Hard Way - an excellent intro to the command line and object-oriented programming. I fondly remember creating a mad text adventure game and giggling the whole time. It was then I got hooked.\nFrom there I kept self-teaching Python and enrolled in a coding bootcamp to accelerate my journey to Software Engineering. I made the jump and have been working as a full-time Software Engineer since 2022.\nI\u0026rsquo;m the type of developer that\u0026rsquo;s never done - learning through personal projects, illuminating my known unknowns as well as the topics of the day. Once work over, I open my own laptop and keep going on projects.

Managing the input, retention and use of this information is thus our responsibility. Writing my thoughts helps to better understand topics as it forces me to clarify them.\nI publish some of my notes in the hope they can be helpful to others.\nCode If you’re curious about the writing and publishing process of this blog, see this note\nYou can find the source code of the blog at github.com/ClemSK/csk-dev\n","permalink":"https://clem-sk.dev/aboutme/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhy keep a personal site?
