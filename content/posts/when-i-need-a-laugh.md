Life is hard and full of challenges so when I want an uncomplicated belly laugh, I just open up the `Gulf of Mexico` programming language docs.

Here are some gems in the language: 
- Add pizzazz by ending each statement with an exclamation mark or three
- Are keywords a problem? Delete them
- Unsure? Use the boolean `maybe`
- Text looking boring? Use rich-text (italics / bold / underline) to differentiate variables
- Want to add `3 + four`? No problem
- Who needs loops? 

It's a hilariously cursed language that should never be used in production, but I love that it exists!

Without further ado, here is the self-styled `perfect programming language`: [Gulf of Mexico](https://github.com/TodePond/GulfOfMexico)
