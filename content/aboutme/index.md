Why bother with a personal website? Why not just write on social media?

[This post captures it well](https://matthiasott.com/notes/simple-truths-about-personal-websites)


## External brain

I write to think, remember, explain to myself and others - in other words [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

## About this site
What you read here are my learning notes, made public to share the journey. 

When I want to reflect on a topic or write an article, I go through my notes and link them together. Often, I find that the links between notes stimulates further connections and associations. The virtuous cycle continues in this process, driven by my wandering curiosity.  

## About me
I'm Clem. I've worked in different fields but my found that my 'home' in programming.

In 2020, wanting automate tasks, I started to learn to code with `Learn Python the Hard Way` - an excellent intro to the command line and object-oriented programming. I fondly remember creating a mad text adventure game and giggling the whole time. It was then I got hooked. 

From there I kept self-teaching Python and enrolled in a coding bootcamp to accelerate my journey to Software Engineering. I made the jump and have been working as a full-time Software Engineer since 2022. 

I'm the type of developer that's never done - learning through personal projects, illuminating my known unknowns as well as the topics of the day. Once work over, I open my own laptop and keep going on projects. My posts leave a trail of what's im my head. 

## Why take notes
>   “Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.”
    
    Tiago Forte, Building A Second Brain

These days we consume vasts amount of information and way more than I can remember. Managing the input, retention and use of this information is thus our responsibility. Writing my thoughts helps to better understand topics as it forces me to clarify them.

I publish some of my notes in the hope they can be helpful to others.
