I've not been myself recently, actually I felt quite depressed.

This is because I've been working through family issues which have led me to feel a lack of motivation and energy even
for the things I enjoy.

This means that I've taken time off building side-projects like:

- Job search AI: CV / Cover-letter / company research generation + clean-tech job site scraping / aggregation
- London Property Pulse: property analytics site

Take a moment, it's about staying in the game and not burning-out.

Instead, I've just been showing up to work and doing the 9 - 5 as I'm not feeling up to doing the extra mile

Though, I've found a lot of value in doing therapy, exercising, going to the sauna and opening up to friends. These are
the usual things that people say but I've found that they really work for me.

It's tough out there, take care of yourself ❤️

I took October and November off from side project work to focus on myself and make sure that I'm doing OK before
going into the holiday season and taking on more. A sign I'm getting better is that recently I've been doing small
things like writing a blog post, which gets me to open my
code editor to get myself thinking about coding for fun again.

As we're gettign to the end of the year, it's ok to slow down, take a break and reflect on the year that has been. Take stock, make yourself whole before getting back to making shit happen. 

You'll come back twice as good and with the ideas flowing 🌊
