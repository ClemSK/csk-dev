Reading a couple of books on launching products made me think about boldness.

Learnt or innate, sometimes the difference between starting, permission, adventure, change and possibility is boldness.

Some wonder, think, turn over, want to have others make decisions for them or are paralysed by in action to make a decision.

I believe the main factor of change is boldness. It leads you to launch yourself in a direction that is only partly known, where the path is lit by a torch beam.

Big or small, rationally or emotionally boldness is a force to be reckoned with, makes ripples and reshapes the world.

As they say, fortune favours the bold.
