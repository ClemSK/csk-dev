# How this blog is created

### Making it easy

I have previously tried blogging but my biggest obstacle was actually platforms used for blogging. Before knowing how to code, I formerly had a WordPress blog that I barely used. While I would write in my note-taking app, I found the publishing process a pain which led me to write privately as an outlet. 

The biggest obstacle to keeping a blog is ease of getting stuff from thought to the internet. It should easy: Write in markdown, make the PR and deploy automagically.

### Hugo

...Enter [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) 👏

Written in Go (my fav programming language), Hugo makes it silly simple to write, build and deploy a static site. 

I wanted writing and exploring to be the focus and have the information stand for itself so a proven and customisable solution like Hugo was an obvious choice.

### Steps

My complete writing and publishing workflow looks like this:

1. Create a new `.md` file
2. Write the post
3. Save the file and run the `hugo` command to regenerate the website
4. Push the code to my repo, which triggers an automatic build with my hosting provider
6. Bam 💥 We’re live! 🚀
