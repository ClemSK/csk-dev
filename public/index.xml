      <title>Debugging in Production</title>

      <description>Challenge: for a week, don&amp;rsquo;t use a debugger and only use the tools you can use to debug in production.
What did you notice? What workflow changes did you make to get to the same level of productivity as before? Why abandon the debugger? The debugger has it&amp;rsquo;s place, but it can be a crutch to crafting well-thought-out software.
As useful a tool as the debugger is, not being able to use a debugger reveals a lot about coding practices and processes.</description>

      <title>Cursed Dev Words</title>

      <description>When developing there are words that are ambiguous when describing a problem.
One of my pet peeves is when I hear someone say these cursed words: &amp;lsquo;it was working&amp;rsquo;
The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s fuzzy and does not help identify causes. Logically it&amp;rsquo;s simplistic - yes, in the last PR is was probably working and now with the new PR it&amp;rsquo;s broken. It should be expected that over time enough code changes will cause breakages.</description>

      <title>Img Size in Md</title>

      <description>Styling images in markdown I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the StackOverflow answer on changing image size in md.
The simplest and dependency free method is just to use a CSS selector to style the image.
This removes the need for markdown processors that would (with more code) end up in the same place.
In Hugo this would mean adding the styles to the assets folder and writing them up this way: img[alt=drawing] { width: 200px; }.</description>

      <title>Writing Process</title>

      <description>How this blog is created Making it easy I have previously tried blogging but my biggest obstacle was actually platforms used for blogging. Before knowing how to code, I formerly had a WordPress blog that I barely used. While I would write in my note-taking app, I found the publishing process a pain which led me to write privately as an outlet.
The biggest obstacle to keeping a blog is ease of getting stuff from thought to the internet.</description>

      <description>Main steps Create a layout Adding Mermaid to a content template Maintaining content and theme styles Rendering an example diagram Mermaid diagram This post outlines how to add Mermaid support with Hugo to render the diagram below, as I found the docs a bit lacking.
When pasting, make sure to move the closing code fence to a new line to see the diagram

      <description>Why keep a personal site? Why not just write on social media?
Personal sites offer a valuable space for self-expression and growth, distinct though not a social-media replacement. The process to publish is as simple as I could make it, leaving more room to think in long-form and do.
I hope for discoveries and personal growth - this is my space to be curious, intentional, and hit publish.
External brain I write to think, remember, explain to myself and others - in other words learn in public.</description>
