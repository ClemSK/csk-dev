      <description>When developing there are words that are ambiguous when describing a problem.
One of my pet peeves is when I hear someone say these cursed words: &amp;lsquo;it was working&amp;rsquo;
The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s fuzzy and does not help identify causes. Logically it&amp;rsquo;s simplistic - yes, in the last PR is was probably working and now with the new PR it&amp;rsquo;s broken. It should be expected that over time enough code changes will cause breakages.</description>
