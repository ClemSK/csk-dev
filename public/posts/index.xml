      <title>Take Care of Yourself</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not been myself recently, actually I felt quite depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through family issues which have led me to feel a lack of motivation and energy even
for the things I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that I&amp;rsquo;ve taken time off building side-projects like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job search AI: CV / Cover-letter / company research generation + clean-tech job site scraping / aggregation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London Property Pulse: property analytics site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment, it&amp;rsquo;s about staying in the game and not burning-out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Big Shifts</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MCP servers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tool calling, is that just another API?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agentic AI and the next trends but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a step back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI and society
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making big waves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seen as the solver of all things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;work will never be the same again&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial revolutions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Mechanical Production (Steam-based machines),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Mass Production (Electrical Energy-based mass production),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd The Digital Age (Computer and internet-based knowledge),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th AI?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT&amp;rsquo;s not the first time that we&amp;rsquo;ve had technology fundamentally change how we operate in society and work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dotcom bubble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crypto bubble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI bubble?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They each left beneficial things in their wake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current wave: quite a lot of job loss but without the hard working conditions - knowledge work is being
transformed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are we not seeing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;changing-the-world&#34;&gt;Changing the world&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might all be a small group of people trying to push a narrative and make some spectacular coin, true it is useful -
to a degree, but it might not be all it&amp;rsquo;s cracked up to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sentiment I&amp;rsquo;ve been resonating more with is that it&amp;rsquo;s good but only just so - the bigger issue is actually knowledge
atrophy and the loss of the craft / imagination of people.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an image can be generated, why draw? If text can be written, why write? if code can be generated, why program?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the problem. One argument is that things should be done for their own sake, but actually relinquishing
full creative output to the Other will lead to a steady decline in faculties we once cherished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My biggest issue is that chatbots confidently give you crap and hallucinate, chasing wild geese. You might as well
go for a walk and have a think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you need a sparring partner, but more often than not, it&amp;rsquo;s just a question of time and a bit more
thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatbots are predictive machines; I&amp;rsquo;d argue the true genius is in human creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is more coming (rethinking of the transformer being the foundation for the next generation of AI, &amp;lsquo;World
models&amp;rsquo;, etc.), but I think the current generation of models is plateauing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLM creativity is bounded by small context and they are unable to solve moderately complex problems in a specific
domain and do tasks that humans find easy still. They are marketed as a solution to drive automation and I agree
to a point. However, they are not an endgame solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find creativity in the hard work, the struggle, the time it takes to make something great. Greatness and expertise
cannot be generated, but it can be assisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where the balance lies: have tasks simplified and pushed along by the chatbots but the real work must come
from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does changing the world mean? Another app? A faster phone / laptop? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;philosophy-and-expression&#34;&gt;Philosophy and expression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking of some of the greatest minds in philosophy (List of your philosopher(s) of choice) - they helped us make
leaps in how we think of ourselves and the choices we make. The major shifts came from deep thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took me some time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning about ML and really enjoying it, thinking of some of the deeper issues made me think about what
really matters to make big change happen - changes of behaviour in society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today computed thought is cheap (meaning of less value than human thought), and attention the currency - Tools should
remain just that. Tools.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of these tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is their value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems a shame to lose one of the essences of humanity: self-expression. If the chatbots homogenise our output, does
culture get flattened? What is the role of art if it&amp;rsquo;s generated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deeper problem is maybe the loss of free thinking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not about faster horses (à la Ford), but where are we going with this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems that we&amp;rsquo;re living in an age of AI where if the words are said enough times, like an incantation, the
miraculous future will come to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems like fanaticism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m of the view the Kasparov expressed, it should be people + machines, not just machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;not-the-last-transformer&#34;&gt;Not the last Transformer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I listened to a podcast about the current architectures for transformer-based models, there is a possibility to move
forward in that direction, but to get to the next generation of models a new architecture is needed. This means more
investment, unfortunately, the industry has invested in the transformer architecture, and it will take an undeniably
better solution to move to a new style of architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that we are still in the first wave of the LLM-based AI change but that this is far from the end of the
line. It is changing work, no doubt, but not the complete human replacement that some people are talking about.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotify: &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5zKGl6HNid03ExP7n5i4U8?si=U7YTCZo_QU2dAKSZjWNNWQ&amp;amp;pi=mTgsDSy2TwCjY&amp;amp;t=0&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I invented the Transformer, now I&amp;rsquo;m replacing it&amp;rdquo; – ML Street Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There have been and will be more waves of AI, as others came before, this is the wave of the chatbot, very public and
accessible but not the endgame
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/J9ZKxsPpRFk?si=WVw4777tKhE_rFE_&#34;&gt;Keynote: Machines, Learning, and Machine Learning - Dylan Beattie - NDC Porto 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like with many technologies, society needs to live with it a bit longer with it to determine its true value. There
will be many more changes before we get to true AGI as some people call it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We just need to work alongside generative AI and integrate it into products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching the 1980s film &amp;lsquo;War Games&amp;rsquo; reminded me of just how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come, but working and living with LLMs isn&amp;rsquo;t the
magic bullet that VCs and AI companies are touting them to be.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Deep Learning for Coders</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/deep-learning-for-coders/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 09:24:10 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI for everyone: pretty good as a foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning for coders: Wow!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, with so many AI products coming out, it seems like a good idea to properly learn what it&amp;rsquo;s all about and how I can build my own models and integrate them into a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my initial foray into learning ML, I found that the &lt;code&gt;AI for Everyone&lt;/code&gt; course by Andrew NG was a good intro to the topic and ideas at a very high level.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good basis for understanding the lay of the land and the different areas to dive into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When I Need a Laugh</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/when-i-need-a-laugh/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 09:42:28 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/when-i-need-a-laugh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life is hard and full of challenges so when I want an uncomplicated belly laugh, I just open up the &lt;code&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/code&gt; programming language docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some gems in the language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add pizzazz by ending each statement with an exclamation mark or three&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are keywords a problem? Delete them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsure? Use the boolean &lt;code&gt;maybe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text looking boring? Use rich-text (italics / bold / underline) to differentiate variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to add &lt;code&gt;3 + four&lt;/code&gt;? No problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who needs loops?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hilariously cursed language that should never be used in production, but I love that it exists!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linking Sendgrid and Cloudflare DNS</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/linking-sendgrid-and-cloudflare-dns/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:38:02 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/linking-sendgrid-and-cloudflare-dns/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this to make sense, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that you have accounts with both &lt;code&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/code&gt; as your DNS provider and &lt;code&gt;SendGrid&lt;/code&gt; as your email provider. If not, hopefully some of this translates or is food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was honestly a pain in the arse, mostly because of the feedback loops for seeing if DNS has worked is measured in &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; and there are no good error messages other than &amp;rsquo;not working&amp;rsquo; in SendGrid. This leaves you guessing and trawling the internet for things to try to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Launching a Site</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/launching-a-site/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:17:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/launching-a-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://london-property-pulse.com&#34;&gt;London Property Pulse&lt;/a&gt; went live. Launching is a euphoric and satisfying moment where you feel &amp;lsquo;Hooray, I&amp;rsquo;m on the Internet 🎉&amp;rsquo;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to launching early 🍻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is definitely far from ready, with bare-bone BE and FE but this way I can see how my changes affect the site&amp;rsquo;s performance and build in public. It also helps my motivation: now it&amp;rsquo;s real and in the world 🌍.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learnings&#34;&gt;Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-familiar-with-linux&#34;&gt;Getting familiar with Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying something new by hosting on a virtual private server (VPS) - aka Linux box in the cloud - and had a few things to learn along the way but got there in about a day. While I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with unix environments, working without the bells and whistles of my comfy and configured environment was a bit of a shock but relatively easy to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Boldness</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/boldness/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 20:42:17 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/boldness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading a couple of books on launching products made me think about boldness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learnt or innate, sometimes the difference between starting, permission, adventure, change and possibility is boldness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some wonder, think, turn over, want to have others make decisions for them or are paralysed by in action to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the main factor of change is boldness. It leads you to launch yourself in a direction that is only partly known, where the path is lit by a torch beam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solo Dev Workflow</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/solo-dev-workflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 13:40:06 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/solo-dev-workflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seems like on the socials people go over the top with &amp;rsquo;the BEST way to be productive is&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large groups, more complex systems arise depending on a project&amp;rsquo;s needs. However, working alone frees me up to get things very lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that 6 things are needed to ship a project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Todo app (Todoist): Kanban board with project tasks + notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calendar (Apple Calendar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes app (Obsidian + Excalidraw): Thoughts + resources + diagrams + documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email client (Apple Mail / Gmail web)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code editor (VS Code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal (Ghostty) with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blinksh/themes?tab=readme-ov-file#seashells&#34;&gt;SeaShells theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser (Edge &amp;hellip;on Mac!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools come and go, I prefer to use a system like &lt;a href=&#34;https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done (GTD)&lt;/a&gt; to stay organised and &lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01&#34;&gt;Shape-up&lt;/a&gt; as a development framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Debugging in Production</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/debugging-in-production/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 08:21:24 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/debugging-in-production/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge: for a week, don&amp;rsquo;t use a debugger and only use the tools you can use to debug in production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did you notice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What workflow changes did you make to get to the same level of productivity as before?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-abandon-the-debugger&#34;&gt;Why abandon the debugger?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debugger has it&amp;rsquo;s place, but it can be a crutch to crafting well-thought-out software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As useful a tool as the debugger is, not being able to use a debugger reveals a lot about coding practices and processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cursed Dev Words</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/cursed-dev-words/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 22:31:31 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/cursed-dev-words/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing there are words that are ambiguous when describing a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my pet peeves is when I hear someone say these cursed words: &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;it was working&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s fuzzy and does not help identify causes. Logically it&amp;rsquo;s simplistic - yes, in the last PR is was probably working and now with the new PR it&amp;rsquo;s broken. It should be expected that over time enough code changes will cause breakages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Img Size in Md</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/img-size-in-md/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 09:06:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/img-size-in-md/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;styling-images-in-markdown&#34;&gt;Styling images in markdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the StackOverflow answer on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14675913/changing-image-size-in-markdown&#34;&gt;changing image size in &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest and dependency free method is just to use a CSS selector to style the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This removes the need for markdown processors that would (with more code) end up in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo this would mean adding the styles to the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; folder and writing them up this way: &lt;code&gt;img[alt=drawing] { width: 200px; }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-this-blog-is-created&#34;&gt;How this blog is created&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-it-easy&#34;&gt;Making it easy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously tried blogging but my biggest obstacle was actually platforms used for blogging. Before knowing how to code, I formerly had a WordPress blog that I barely used. While I would write in my note-taking app, I found the publishing process a pain which led me to write privately as an outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to keeping a blog is ease of getting stuff from thought to the internet. It should easy: Write in markdown, make the PR and deploy automagically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Mermaid With Hugo</title>
      <link>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/using-mermaid-with-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 08:35:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clem-sk.dev/posts/using-mermaid-with-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-steps&#34;&gt;Main steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding Mermaid to a content template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining content and theme styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rendering an example diagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mermaid-diagram&#34;&gt;Mermaid diagram&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post outlines how to add Mermaid support with Hugo to render the diagram below, as I found the docs a bit lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pasting, make sure to move the closing code fence to a new line to see the diagram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;prevail!
    John--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Alice: Great!
    John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Bob: How about you?
    Bob--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Jolly good!```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-a-layout&#34;&gt;Creating a layout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mermaid markdown diagrams aren&amp;rsquo;t supported natively by Hugo, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to add.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
