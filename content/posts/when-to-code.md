coding is usually the last thing you will need to do in the process of making something.

There needs to be a real need to spend the resources to make a piece of software.

There are processes

- check there are clear intent assets e.g. technical brief and design work
- thinking through the architecture and componentisation of the design / features
- white-boarding architecture and design / pseudo code more complex elements of implementation
- do it two or three times before automating it
- do it simple / self contained until it needs to be more complicated
