Welcome 🤗 I’m Clem a Software Engineer from London. I write about technical and human topics, enjoy ☺️

Currently, I work at [nudge](https://nudge-global.com/), though on the side I'm building a London property analytics dashboard using Go, Templ, HTMX, Tailwind and Postgres. It's not launched yet but I will link to it eventually.

If this is your first time here, or if you’d like to know more about me and how I’ve set up this blog, I suggest you visit the [Start Here](http://clem-sk.dev/aboutme/) page.

You can also read this blog in your preferred RSS reader [here](http://localhost:1313/posts/index.xml).
