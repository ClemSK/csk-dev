Getting familiar with Linux
I&rsquo;m trying something new by hosting on a virtual private server (VPS) - aka Linux box in the cloud - and had a few things to learn along the way but got there in about a day. While I&rsquo;m familiar with unix environments, working without the bells and whistles of my comfy and configured environment was a bit of a shock but relatively easy to work."><meta name=author content="Clement Seconde-Kynnersley"><link rel=canonical href=https://clem-sk.dev/posts/launching-a-site/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.986fe03b6849f98be5000b7e092db54278d597af9b7d3aba06d460674d698475.css integrity="sha256-mG/gO2hJ+YvlAAt+CS21QnjVl6+bfTq6BtRgZ01phHU=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://clem-sk.dev/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://clem-sk.dev/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://clem-sk.dev/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://clem-sk.dev/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://clem-sk.dev/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://clem-sk.dev/posts/launching-a-site/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Launching a Site"><meta property="og:description" content="Yesterday London Property Pulse went live.

It also helps my motivation: now it‚Äôs real and in the world üåç.\nLearnings Getting familiar with Linux I‚Äôm trying something new by hosting on a virtual private server (VPS) - aka Linux box in the cloud - and had a few things to learn along the way but got there in about a day. While I‚Äôm familiar with unix environments, working without the bells and whistles of my comfy and configured environment was a bit of a shock but relatively easy to work.\nExceeding low resources is way to easy I started using the most basic plan my VPS provider offered but quickly found that it was running out of memory as I was trying to build my docker images. In the end I bumped up the spec twice to get the performance necessary to run my setup. As I‚Äôm going to be using a lot data the additional disk space was welcome but I thought that might come later in the process than it did. It was an eye opener that my setup couldn‚Äôt run properly on 1GB of memory, however performant.\nResponsibility for being in control ‚ÄòNice I control everything! ..oh, I have to manage what now?!‚Äô\nPart of launching this site was to learn how to manage the details of hosting a site, saving costs, getting in the weeds of devops and so far ‚úÖ. Though, I have had to configure ports, permissions, miscellaneous configurations and a firewall. I now understand that managed services charge more, but honestly for a little more hassle and significantly smaller bill it‚Äôs worth it. The flip side is that I now have more freedom about what happens on my server than the likes of Vercel, Railway and Netlify would expose to me.\nDNS This time around it was much easier to hook up my domain to my IP address and register it with the registrar. Last time I struggled with configuration of my domain with Netlify and Cloudflare name servers. Maybe I‚Äôm getting better, or just following standard practice better ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The harder part of the launch of my site was getting my pipeline to work correctly.\nDocker and pipeline secrets + automating builds As good practice I have my pipeline build and push my code to my container registry and then use the new image to deploy to my VPS. However, I found working with GitHub and Docker a bit of a faff. I worked it out in the end but it took about a million runs of the pipeline and debugging the statements before getting a clean run and deploying to the VPS. Part of the issue was the lack of power of the VPS making it impossible to run the code. I had to restart the VPS several times when it would even refuse SSH connections.\nArchitecture I watched a great talk from Amazon on YT which outlines realistic architectures at different scales and studied the system design primer. They helped guide me to not over-engineer my current approach but also prepare for scale.\nThere are 4 parts to the setup: 1. Docker, 2. Caddy, 3. Go, 4. React, 5.Postgres\nContainerisation with Docker The main benefits of Docker are consistent environments and easy replication. Due to this, it means I can have secure builds that can be deployed and scaled to multiple instances as needed. It would also make it easy to move to anther cloud provider.\nCaddy web server Caddy acts as the front-door to the site and works in a monorepo or micro-services contexts. I set up the web server to act as a reverse proxy, file server and rate-limiter, with capabilities for load-balancing and Caddy made that a breeze.\nGo backend I chose Go mostly because I like it but it‚Äôs also performant, resource efficient, has great concurrency and can be deployed in Linux, Mac and Windows environments.\nReact frontend React was mostly a fallback and could have been another framework but is fast to get started and has a large ecosystem to leverage. I tried using Templ but found that it was too limiting and slowing me down for trivial things that would be easy to do in a React context. Ultimately, I used React because if Templ was challenging to use and there was very little code, what would it be like when there was complexity and a lot more code? Moreover, Templ‚Äôs state management story was not for me. In this situation I picked a larger bundle size, JS/TS, speed, and a broader ecosystem over server rendering interactions.\nPostgres database Choosing between Postgres and MongoDB as a starting option, my view is that Postgres is the sensible default. I like the structure of types and querying power of a relational DB. That being said, my application is going to be read heavy and I will be performing a number of queries on the data so a relational DB makes more sense at this point.\nNow the real work starts I felt a need to launch the site, now it is I can start on core feature work that will bring the site to life. üöÄ\n","wordCount":"910","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-05T11:17:51Z","dateModified":"2025-01-05T11:17:51Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Clement Seconde-Kynnersley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://clem-sk.dev/posts/launching-a-site/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Clem SK","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://clem-sk.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/ accesskey=h title="Clem SK (Alt + H)">Clem SK</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/aboutme/ title="Start Here"><span>Start Here</span></a></li><li><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://clem-sk.dev/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://clem-sk.dev/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Launching a Site</h1><div class=post-meta><div class=post-meta><span title=2025-01-05T11:17:51Z>January 5, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;910 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;<strong><a href=/tags/launching/>#launching</a></strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=/tags/site/>#site</a></strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=/tags/mvp/>#mvp</a></strong></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Yesterday <a href=https://london-property-pulse.com>London Property Pulse</a> went live.
