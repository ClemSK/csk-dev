# Cloudflare DNS + Netlify host

- netlify hosting
- cloudflare dns
- 

I went with Netlify as it makes it very simple to deploy a static site and has a useful CLI for future deployments. 

I chose Cloudflare as it's a cost effective domain name provider that also has all the services that I could ever need.
