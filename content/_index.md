Welcome ü§ó I‚Äôm Clem a Software Engineer from London. I write about technical and human topics, enjoy ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Currently, I work at [nudge](https://nudge-global.com/), though on the side I'm building a property analytics dashboard called [London Property Pulse](https://london-property-pulse.com) using Go, React and Postgres. FYI it's still very much in beta.

If this is your first time here, or if you‚Äôd like to know more about me and how I‚Äôve set up this blog, I suggest you visit the [Start Here](http://clem-sk.dev/aboutme/) page.
