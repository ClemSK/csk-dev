- 6 weeks off to unplug between jobs

  - coding project
  - gym + sightseeing + friends
  - traveling
  - getting back into the groove

- letting go
  identity crisis
  opening up to big ideas
  finding purpose
  thinking bigger picture
  exploring
  going in nature

what it means to be a software engineer slips away

From person that couldn't put my project down to to someone that didn't want to look at an editor (I even forgot the shortcuts...)

Social, cultural, physical and spiritual pursuits.

I wish I could do this every year

checking my health
dealing with a good amount of life admin

getting bored and then getting lost
