# Welcome!

Why bother with a personal website? Why not just write on social media?

[This post captures it well](https://matthiasott.com/notes/simple-truths-about-personal-websites)

These articles came out particularly well, and might provide some value to you, or help you get to know me a little better.

## External brain

I write to think and remember, explain to myself and others. 

I intended to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) and share the experience.

## About this site
What you read here is the public section of my personal notes - I keep a large collection of notes which are stored locally in markdown. When I study, I take notes about what I learn and store them.

When I want to reflect on a certain topic or write an article, I go through my collection of notes and link them together. Often I find that the links between articles stimulates further connections and associations. The virtuous cycle continues with this process, driven by my wandering curiosity.  

I decided to make part of my notes public so that I can share my coding learning journey. 

## About me
I'm Clem. I've worked in different fields (insurance, privacy) but my found that my passion lies in software. 

In 2020, wanting automate tasks, I started to learn to code with `Learn Python the Hard Way` - which I found an excellent introduction to working on the command line and learning about object-oriented programming. I fondly remember creating a mad text adventure game to solidify my knowledge and laughing the whole way through. It was then I realized I was hooked. 

From there I kept self-teaching Python and then enrolled in a coding bootcamp to accelerate my journey to Software Engineering and succeeded in turning my passion into a career and I've been working as a full-time Software Engineer since 2022. 

I'm the type of developer that is never done - learning through personal projects, deepening my knowledge in my known unknowns as well as the topics of the day. Once done with work, I open my own laptop and keep going on my own project. My posts will leave a trail of what's im my head when you read this. 

## Why take notes
>   “Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.”
    
    Tiago Forte, Building A Second Brain

These days we consume vasts amount of information and way more than I can remember. Managing the input, retention and use of this information is thus our responsibility. Writing down my thoughts helps me understand the topic much better as it forces me to clarify my thoughts.

I publish some of my notes in the hope they may be helpful to others.
