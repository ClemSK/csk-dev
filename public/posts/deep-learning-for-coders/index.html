AI for everyone: pretty good as a foundation.
Deep learning for coders: Wow!

In 2025, with so many AI products coming out, it seems like a good idea to properly learn what it&rsquo;s all about and how I can build my own models and integrate them into a project.
In my initial foray into learning ML, I found that the AI for Everyone course by Andrew NG was a good intro to the topic and ideas at a very high level.
It&rsquo;s a good basis for understanding the lay of the land and the different areas to dive into."><meta name=author content="Clement Seconde-Kynnersley"><link rel=canonical href=https://clem-sk.dev/posts/deep-learning-for-coders/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.986fe03b6849f98be5000b7e092db54278d597af9b7d3aba06d460674d698475.css integrity="sha256-mG/gO2hJ+YvlAAt+CS21QnjVl6+bfTq6BtRgZ01phHU=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://clem-sk.dev/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://clem-sk.dev/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://clem-sk.dev/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://clem-sk.dev/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://clem-sk.dev/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://clem-sk.dev/posts/deep-learning-for-coders/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Deep Learning for Coders"><meta property="og:description" content="tl;dr
