Seems like on the socials people go over the top with 'the BEST way to be productive is...".

In large groups, more complex systems arise depending on a project's needs. However, working alone frees me up to get things very lean.

The reality is that 6 things are needed to ship a project:

- Todo app (Todoist): Kanban board with project tasks + notes
- Calendar (Apple Calendar)
- Notes app (Obsidian + Excalidraw): Thoughts + resources + diagrams + documentation
- Email client (Apple Mail / Gmail web)
- Code editor (VS Code)
- Terminal (Ghostty) with [SeaShells theme](https://github.com/blinksh/themes?tab=readme-ov-file#seashells)
- Browser (Edge ...on Mac!)

Tools come and go, I prefer to use a system like [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) to stay organised and [Shape-up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01) as a development framework.

The key aspects for me are:

- The ability to access and update my system wherever I am
  - Robust and stable apps that can be used on mobile, desktop and web
  - Handoff/syncing between devices
- Integration of
  - Email client calendar with my desktop and phone calendar
  - Todo app with all calendars

This setup enables me to be the most effective, capture inspiration, manage my time and ship.

### Update: 26 November 2025
Todoist Kanban was replaced by [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) by JetBrains as it combines spaces for documentation and tasks while also having a mobile app that allows me to manage tasks and docs on the go.

VS Code was replaced by [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as my primary IDEs. This came after I've been using [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) as my primary IDE at work and wanted to use better tools when developing my side projects.

My theme of choice in the JetBrains IDEs is the [Night Owl Material Theme](https://material-theme.com/) and when in VS Code, I use the [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) plugin theme by Sarah Drasner.
