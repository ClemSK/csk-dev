Welcome, I’m Clem a Software Engineer from London. This is my public thoughts repo where I publish about technical topics that interest me. Currently my focus is Go and applying it to develop microservices and cloud-native tech.

If this is your first time here, or if you’d like to know more about me and how I’ve set up this blog, I suggest you visit the [Start Here](http://clem-sk.dev/aboutme/) page.

You can also read this blog in your preferred RSS reader [here](http://localhost:1313/posts/index.xml).
