what it means to be a software engineer slips away

From person that couldn't put my project down to to someone that didn't want to look at an editor (I even forgot the shortcuts...)

Social, cultural, physical and spiritual pursuits.

I wish I could do this every year

checking my health
dealing with a good amount of life admin

getting bored and then getting lost

The weirdest part - don't know if from change of environment or from the disconnection in my break but I no longer feel the desperate need to be building all the time.

I think that part of is is that I landed a job and that I no longer need to prove myself: my job is enough and I can let go / enjoy myself

I don't need to chain myself to my desk and crank out code.

I know myself and the urge to code will come back - I've not had a prolonged stretches in my life where working / studying outside of work was not needed. For the first time in a while I feel like I can just go to work, learn the stack be productive but then not open my laptop at the weekends. It's lovely!

In 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2023 I've taken time at the Christmas period to learn, study and it felt like the holiday season was stolen away from me.

I've started wearing glasses, I think partly due to getting older but also because I have been pushing myself more and that probably had consequences on my eyesight.
