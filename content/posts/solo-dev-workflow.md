Seems like on the socials people go over the top with 'the BEST way to be productive is...".

In large groups, more complex systems arise depending on a project's needs. However, working alone frees me up to get things very lean.

The reality is that 6 things are needed to ship a project:

- Todo app (Todoist): Kanban board with project tasks + notes
- Calendar (Apple Calendar)
- Notes app (Obsidian / Apple Notes - previously used Evernote and Notion): Thoughts + resources + diagrams + documentation
- Email client (Apple Mail / Gmail web)
- Code editor + terminal (VS Code)
- Browser (Firefox developer edition)

Tools come and go, I prefer to use a system like [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) to stay organised and [Shape-up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01) as a development framework.

The key aspects for me are:

- The ability to access and update my system wherever I am
  - Robust and stable apps that can be used on mobile, desktop and web
  - Handoff/syncing between devices
- Integration of
  - Email client calendar with my desktop and phone calendar
  - Todo app with all calendars

This setup enables me to be the most effective, capture inspiration, manage my time and ship.
