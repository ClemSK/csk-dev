# How this blog is created

### Making it easy

I have previously tried blogging but my biggest obstacle was actually platforms used for blogging. I formerly had a WordPress blog that I barely used. While I would write in my note-taking apps I found the publishing process a pain which led me to write privately as an outlet. 

The biggest obstacle to keeping a blog is ease of getting stuff from thought to the internet. It should be *almost* as easy as writing a note on your phone. 

### Hugo

Written in Go (my fav programming language), Hugo makes it silly simple to write, build and deploy a static site. 

### Steps

My complete writing and publishing workflow looks like this:

1. Create a new `.md` file
2. Write the post
3. Save the file and run the `hugo` command to regenerate the website
4. Push the code to my repo, which triggers an automatic build with my hosting provider
6. Bam 💥 We’re live! 🚀
