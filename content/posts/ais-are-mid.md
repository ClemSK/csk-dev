The order in which reach for resources in:

- The docs
- stack overflow / articles
- AI

In the beginning, my experience with AI, like many others was 'wow, this is magic'. Next I thought, 'shit, maybe I might not have a job in a few years'. More recently, I've been thinking 'it can do a lot of stuff, on the simple side but it's not that good'. I've sometimes wasted 30min trying different prompts and getting nowhere, to then reading the docs and quickly finding a solution.

Anecdotally, a colleague that used AI constantly was fired - they had issues that went beyond the extensive use of AI - but unquestionnably their code was a mess and didn't follow company coding style.

Ultimately we code for other humans, it's incidentally also read by machines. Generating unmaintainable crap is not a viable option.

- Illusion of speed
  - Increased in productivity increased expectations for deadlines and so there is less time for quality.
- Code quality
  - human: copy pasta / not always understanding
  - machine: out dated / old practices, does not have full context, hallucination
- Lost learning opportunities
  - not working through a problem, copy pasting
  - juniors staying juniors
